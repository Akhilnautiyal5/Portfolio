					<strong>The clockmaker's Apprentice</strong>
				</p>
				<p style="margin-top: 10px">
					In a quiet mountain village nestled between the pines, lived an old
					clockmaker named Mr. Harwin. Known for his intricate timepieces,
					Harwin was respected but solitary—his shop filled with ticking marvels
					and stories never told. One morning, a boy named Eli, with smudged
					glasses and an insatiable curiosity, knocked on his door.
					<br /><br />
					“I want to learn how to fix time,” Eli said.<br />
					Harwin chuckled. “You mean build clocks?”<br />
					“No,” Eli replied. “Fix time. Make it count.”<br /><br />
					Amused, Harwin accepted him as an apprentice. Day after day, Eli
					learned to carve gears, align springs, and listen—not just to the
					ticks of clocks, but to the rhythm of life. At first, his hands
					trembled. He broke more than he fixed. But Harwin never scolded him.
					“Precision grows from patience,” he’d say.
				</p>
				<br /><br />

						width: 100%;
						border-radius: 10px;
						box-shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
					"

			</div>

			<p>
				One snowy afternoon, Harwin fell ill. The village panicked—a large town
				bell had stopped, and it was tradition to ring it during the Winter
				Festival. “Without that bell,” a villager said, “the festival can’t
				begin.” Everyone turned to Eli.<br /><br />
				Trembling, Eli entered Harwin’s workshop alone. He studied the bell’s
				mechanism. Remembering everything—the balance, the weight, the
				patience—he worked through the night. By dawn, his fingers were
				blistered, but the bell’s hammer was ready.<br /><br />
				As the sun rose, the bell rang through the village. Cheers erupted. The
				festival began, brighter than ever.<br />
				Harwin, weak but smiling, whispered, “You didn’t just fix a bell. You
				fixed time—for everyone.”<br /><br />
				Years later, Eli became the village’s clockmaker. But he taught more
				than mechanics. He taught children to see wonder in small gears, the
				value of quiet effort, and that even when time seems broken, it can be
				rebuilt—with hope and heart.
